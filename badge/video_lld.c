/*
 * This module implements a video playback routine for the Freescale/NXP
 * KW01 and a 320x240 display with ILI9341 chip. It's fairly rudimentary
 * and relies on several gimmicks. We're limited in terms of I/O performance
 * due to the fact that a) the SD card and screen share the same SPI port,
 * b) our system clock is limited to 48MHz and c) some SD cards are slower
 * than others.
 *
 * Best performance is achieved when using full speed SPI clock and an SD
 * card of class 4 or better. As of this writing, we run the SPI clock
 * at full speed using the micro SD card port on the East Rising display
 * module. Early prototype hardware using the MCU Friend display modules
 * and standard size SD cards was not fast enough to handle the maximum
 * rate and the clock was limited to half speed to compensate. Currently
 * we implement DMA with the SPI controller. This, in conjunction with
 * the full 12MHz SPI clock rate gives us sufficient I/O bandwidth even
 * with class 4 cards.
 *
 * We use a video frame resolution of 128x96 pixels and a frame rate of 8
 * frames per second. The 128x96 resolution is upscaled on the fly to the
 * full 320x240 resolution of the display. This is a little tricky because
 * it results in a ratio of 2.5 to 1. Upscaling by a factor of 2 would be
 * easy, but 2.5 is slightly more complicated. (You can't draw half a pixel.)
 *
 * The upscaling is accomplished using the following algorithm:
 *
 * - We always draw each pixel twice
 * - Every other pixel is drawn three times
 * - We also always draw every scanline twice
 * - Every other scanline is drawn three times
 *
 * This results in a cadence of 1:2, 1:3, 1:2, 1:3, etc... which yields
 * an overall increase of 2.5.
 *
 * Audio playback is accomplished using the DAC. Audio and video are stored
 * in the same file. The audio sample rate has been deliberately chosen to
 * be 9216Hz. This results in 12 audio samples for each 128-pixel scanline 
 * in a video frame at a rate of 8 frames per second. Audio is played by
 * loading samples into a buffer and having each sample written to the DAC
 * data register by an interrupt service routine tied to one of the interval
 * timers, which is set to trigger at the same frequency as the audio
 * sample rate.
 *
 * The video and audio are stored on the SD card in a single file with the
 * video pixel data and audio sample data interleaved using the following
 * pattern:
 *
 * [ 2 video scanlines (256 pixels) ][ 24 audio samples ]
 * [ 2 video scanlines (256 pixels) ][ 24 audio samples ]
 * [ 2 video scanlines (256 pixels) ][ 24 audio samples ]
 *
 * When playing back, each interleaved chunk is read back and the audio
 * is stored in a buffer while the video is written to the screen. When
 * enough audio samples have been buffered, the DAC is allowed to play
 * them.
 *
 * To maintain synchronization, each time a new chunk of samples is queued
 * up to play, we wait until the previous chunk of samples has completed
 * playing before proceeding. This kills two birds with one stone: first, it
 * ensures the video and audio stay in sync, and second it keeps both audio
 * and video playing at the correct rate. Since the video is synced to the
 * audio, as long as we play the audio at the correct rate, which is
 * enforced by the interval timer, the video will implicitly be forced to
 * play at the correct rate too.
 *
 * Encoding of the video and audio is done on a host system using ffmpeg.
 * The video is extracted as individual uncompressed frames in the native
 * RGB565 pixel format supported by the ILI9341 display controller. The
 * audio is converted to 16-bit monoaural raw sample data, and then processed
 * with a custom utility to convert the 16-bit samples to 12-bit samples
 * (which is the resulution limit of the DAC). Finally, another custom
 * program combines the raw video and audio samples together.
 *
 * If the SD card is too slow, things will still work, but there will be
 * pauses between the audio samples, which will make things sound choppy
 * or warbly. To compensate for this, an optional feature is available
 * which allows us to detect if we are processing samples faster than
 * we can load new ones, and if so we reduce the interval timer
 * frequency until we hit a rate that we can sustain. Hopefully this
 * condition should not arise very often with the production hardware.
 * With the currently available SD card I/O bandwidth, we no don't have
 * any problems keeping up, so this feature is disabled by default to
 * conserve code size.

* to be the encoded horizontal video width (which is currently 128 pixels).

* Since the video is 128x96 pixels and the display is 320x240, we upscale

* the scanline is drawn a third time as well. This results in each line
* being drawn 2.5 times. The write_pixel() function used to place each
* pixel on the screen uses a similar transformation.
*
* Note that we manually draw the pixels rather than using DMA to draw each
* display line. This is an intentional design trade-off. Since we perform
* a transformation on each scanline before writing it to the screen, we
* would have to allocate an additional RAM buffer and put the formatted
